We are considering launching a new AI-powered personal finance assistant app. The app would use machine learning to analyze spending patterns, provide budgeting recommendations, and offer personalized investment advice.

Key features include:
- Automatic transaction categorization
- Real-time spending alerts
- Predictive budget forecasting
- Robo-advisor investment recommendations
- Financial goal tracking

The target market is millennials and Gen Z users who are digitally native but may lack formal financial education. We estimate a development timeline of 18 months with a team of 12 people and a budget of $2.5 million.

We believe this product could capture 5% of the personal finance app market within two years of launch, generating approximately $15 million in annual recurring revenue through a freemium model with premium features at $9.99/month.
